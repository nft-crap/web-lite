The History of Veel-Tark is not only the story of the creation of a city; it is, above all, the genesis of a dream, of a magical space that takes the form of a gigantic cenacle where great knowledge and wisdom can be brought together.

Veel-Tark is thus a decentralised universe, where information is available to all. It is, in essence, a great game board that is projected on the subtle plane through the imagination of all its citizens.

Yes, Veel-Tark is a game, a game of puzzles, riddles and quests; but it is also a statement of principles and values. It is a proposal for the future, a world of portals to hidden wisdom, to a universal community, to decentralised knowledge.

Because knowledge is power. On each of us, as players, depends the use we make of it.
